# toughbugs
A Tool for running popular Antimicrobial Resistance Software

With multiple databases and tools available to examine short read sequences for antimicrobial determinants, it became necessary to build a pipeline that utilises all of these platforms into a single, easy to execute pipeline.

Toughbugs requires a few databases to be downloaded and updated, namely ariba, Amrfinder and CARD. after this has been done, all that is needed is a fasta file, fastq.gz files and the pipeline will run from the environment in which the files are located.
